**Escaping Strings**
quotes*inside a string*
In JavaScript, you use the backslash to **escape** other characters.
*Escaping a character* tells JavaScript to ignore the character’s special meaning and just use the literal value of the character.
Example: “The man whispered, \”please speak to me.\”” is correct
		  “The man whispered, ”please speak to me.””  Creates a syntax error.

## Special characters
Quotes aren’t the only**special characters**that need to be escaped, there’s actually [quite a few] However, to keep it simple, here’s a list of some common special characters in JavaScript.

code  character
\\  	\ (backslash)
\”  	’’ (double quote)
\’	  ‘ (single quote)
\n  	newline
\t  	tab

The last two characters listed in the table, newline\n and tab\t, are unique because they add additional **whitespace** to your Strings. A newline character will add a line break and a tab character will advance your line to the next tab stop
